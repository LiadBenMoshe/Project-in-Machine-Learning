# Project-in-Machine-Learning


In this project we took a database of high school students, with data such as:
Alcohol drinking habits, marital status, academic status, social status and test scores.
We used 4 different methods such as adaboost, svm, knn, NN.
We tried to predict all kinds of characteristics based on the data, detailed each method and showed the results of its success, and wrote conclusions.
